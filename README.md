# RISCV-Processor-Simulator
Project for Computing Systems Architecture Course (ECE-6913)

Complete code is inside the folder gm3386 named as “main.py”. 

The language used for the project is python.

In order to run the code, the following structure of files should be followed, and no other external libraries need to be installed.

Inside gm3386 the main.py is present and inside Input, the testcases are present.

 
Running the program:
go to project folder in terminal and Run the command:
 => python net_id/main.py main.py file is in gm3386 folder
The final code is available in gm3386/main.py

Measure and report average CPI, Total execution cycles, and Instructions per cycle by adding performance monitors to your code. Make sure you output these values to a file.

Testcase 0:
Single Stage Core Performance Metrics Total execution cycles = 6
Average CPI = 1.2
Instructions per cycle = 0.833333
Five Stage Core Performance Metrics: Number of cycles taken: 10
Cycles per instruction: 2.0 Instructions per cycle: 0.5
 
Testcase 1:
Single Stage Core Performance Metrics Total execution cycles = 40
Average CPI = 1.02564
Instructions per cycle = 0.975001
Five Stage Core Performance Metrics Number of cycles taken: 46
Cycles per instruction: 1.17949 Instructions per cycle: 0.847824
 
Testcase 2:
Single Stage Core Performance Metrics Total execution cycles = 7
Average CPI = 1.75
Instructions per cycle = 0.571429
